InnovateX hackathon Submission

Ok, so basically this is the first time I am making a chess engine. On my first try at this hackathon, I made what is in this repo as OriginalProject.py as I didn't know if I would be putting it in Arena GUI or how these engines really worked. So the actual submission is main.py but I would just like to add OriginalProject.py for fun.

I am not sure if this will even work as I am unable to test it out on my own device.
